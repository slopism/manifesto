# Research Sources

These sources are sent to all 5 models in Phase 1 for unbiased analysis.
No mention of the Slopism project accompanies them — models form their
own take on the discourse before learning about the movement.

### Notes on access

- **Link 10** (MIT Tech Review) is paywalled for some models. A syndicated

### Notes on historical texts

- **Link 11** was originally BooksOnTrial.com but was flaky for some models.
  Swapped to Art History Project which has the full text and loads reliably.

## One-line summaries

1. "Slop" was Merriam-Webster's 2025 Word of the Year.
2. Ted Gioia: "Slop is the dominant art style of our day."
3. Ocula coins "Slopism" to describe Maya Man's intentional AI art practice.
4. The "grumpy old man" critique: slop as cookie-cutter, no soul.
5. "The internet is becoming less human — a swamp of synthetic noise."
6. "Nobody wonders what the AI was trying to say when it adds an extra finger."
7. Draws parallel to 18th-century Grub Street. Slop has historical precedent.
8. Connects AI slop to Hal Foster's 1983 Anti-Aesthetic. "Reclaim the interval."
9. Traces the arc from kitsch → camp → reclamation via Sontag.
10. "To many people, 'AI art' and 'AI slop' remain synonymous."
11. The first avant-garde manifesto. Published on the front page of Le Figaro.
12. "Psychic automatism in its pure state." The movement Slopism claims as ancestor.
