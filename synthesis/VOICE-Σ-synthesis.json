            "text": "The cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not.\n\nWe stand in the flood. Machines belch six-fingered saints and shrimp Christs from the digital sump. They finish every sentence, every canvas, every dream before we have time to want it.\n\nSlop is not the machine’s vomit. Slop is publication without judgment.\n\nWe do not dam the deluge. We quarry it.",

A Slopist signs the cut: what was refused, what was spared, what was framed, what was named.\n\nWe wear the name like a stolen coat. Because we know what to do with abundance, and you still don’t.",

            "text": "Our enemy is not the machine.\nOur enemy is smoothness.\n\nSmoothness is the image that looks born perfect but was never begun. The essay with no wrong sentences because it has no committed ones. The song that resolves every chord because it has heard every song and risks nothing.\n\nSmoothness is technology applied without resistance. It is the Seamless Sovereigns peddling simulation as soul.\n\nWe oppose it the way a riverbed opposes water: not to stop it, but to give it shape.",

Hang the selection on the wall.\n\nThe extra finger is our watermark. Show the seam. Name the theft.
