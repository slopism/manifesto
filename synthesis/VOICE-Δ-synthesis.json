            "text": "Machines have learned to finish your sentences. They will finish all of them if you let them.\n\nThey call the overflow slop: a pollution event, the grey goo of culture. We see a quarry.\n\nWe do not intend to dam the flood. We intend to carve a channel through it.",

            "notes": "Kept Ω’s compressed threat-and-refusal as the ignition, then stole Φ’s quarry reframing to flip disgust into material. No exposition, just stance."

        "naming": {
            "text": "They called us slop. Good.\n\nWe wear the name like a stolen coat. Not because we love garbage, but because we know what to do with abundance.\n\nA Slopist does not sign a prompt. A Slopist signs the cut: what was refused, what was spared, what was framed, what was named.",

            "notes": "Used Ψ’s image to make the reclamation feel physical, then Δ’s identity clause to anchor the movement’s signature in the cut, not the prompt."

            "text": "Generation is weather. It will keep raining.\n\nThe cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not. Minutes to generate, hours to verify: the expense is pushed downstream into unpaid attention.\n\nIn the flood, everything looks finished and nothing has been judged. Slopism begins at the first no.",

            "notes": "Ω’s thesis is the engine; Δ’s weather metaphor adds inevitability and the verification burden. Ended on the first no to transition cleanly into demands."

        "enemy": {
            "text": "Our enemy is not the machine. Our enemy is smoothness.\n\nSmoothness is the image that looks finished but was never begun. The essay with no wrong sentences because it risks no committed sentences. The prompt-and-accept mind.\n\nSmoothness is technology applied without resistance, and deception as a style. We oppose it the way a riverbed opposes water: not to stop it, but to give it shape.",

            "notes": "Ω’s 'smoothness' survives intact because it names what the reader already feels. Added Ψ’s 'prompt-and-accept' mindset and Φ’s anti-simulation edge without turning it into a Luddite rant."

        "demands": {
            "text": "1. Generate nothing you have not also destroyed. A Slopist’s portfolio is a cemetery.\n2. Hide nothing. Show the seam. Six-fingered saints are our watermark.\n3. The unit is the cut. Not the output, not the prompt: the selection, the frame, the sequence.\n4. Starve infinity on purpose. Use constraints that make judgment visible.\n5. A test: if your work can be swapped with a thousand near-twins and nothing essential changes, it is slop.",

            "notes": "Kept demands as ruthless imperatives. Ω provides the ethic and the cemetery. Δ provides the cut and the swap-test. Σ supplies the emblematic 'six-fingered saint.' Φ contributes the watermark logic without the brittle 1:10,000 fetish."

            "text": "We are Duchamp’s children in an age where everything is already a readymade.\n\nThe Dadaists cut newspapers; we cut the entire internet and call it starting material. The Surrealists sought the uninvited sentence; we let the model spill, then we wake up and mean it.\n\nWe keep the machine and drop the worship. Someone still decides what hangs.",

            "text": "The flood is engineered. It has owners, and it has victims.\n\nTaste becomes verification labor; culture becomes extraction. The market is not a judge. It is a cashier. Most slop is produced and cleaned by people paid fractions of pennies, while platforms sell the illusion of effortless art.\n\nSlopism refuses to launder that theft into “content.” We disclose provenance, we credit, we pay, we build with the commons, or we do not publish.",

            "notes": "Δ’s downstream-cost framing is the clearest. Ω and Σ force the word 'extraction' to stay in the room. Added one concrete refusal (do not publish without provenance/credit) to close the credibility gap the drafts admit."

            "text": "You will ask: but is it art?\n\nWe will answer by making work that can only exist through judgment. The art was never in the tool. It was in the no.\n\nLeave the slop on the floor. Hang the selection on the wall. Nail this where the flood can see it.\n\nWe work in the flood. We do not drown. We choose.",
