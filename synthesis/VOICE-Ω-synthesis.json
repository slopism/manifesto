        "generation_disclosure": "Five AI voices wrote independently. A human selected, cut, sequenced, and directed the synthesis. A sixth AI performed the final merge. The seams are visible by design. This document is Slopist in method: the manifesto practices what it demands.",
        "method": "For each section: the strongest single expression was preferred over compromise. Where no voice was strong enough alone, lines were grafted across voices. Feral imagery was kept as the flag; philosophical precision was kept as the spine. Nothing was included to be representative. Everything was included to survive."

            "notes": "Ω's opening is the only one that earns its brevity. Two beats: threat as fact, then refusal. The word 'intend' implies will, not hope. Σ's opening has more voltage but risks alienating anyone not already converted. Ψ's 'drowning in abundance' is accurate but inert. Φ's 'landfill/quarry' reframe is strong but belongs later. A flagship manifesto must open with a line a skeptic can't dismiss. This is that line."

        "naming": {
            "text": "They call it slop — the culture's name for everything it fears about the flood. The Impressionists were named by a critic who meant it as a slur. The Fauves were called wild beasts. We take the word and nail it to our door.\n\nA Slopist does not sign a prompt. A Slopist signs the cut: what was refused, what survived, what was named.",

            "best_line": "A Slopist signs the cut.",
            "notes": "Ω provides the reclamation-by-historical-precedent move (Impressionists, Fauves), which is the most intellectually honest way to own the slur. Δ provides the operational identity: the unit of Slopism is the cut, not the prompt. Σ's 'lick it off the floor' and Ψ's 'stolen coat' are vivid but narrower — they reclaim without redefining. The synthesis needs both acts: take the name, then say what the name means in practice."

        "diagnosis": {
            "text": "Here is the century's problem, stated plainly:\n\nThe cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not. It has never been higher.\n\nEvery revolution in production lowered one barrier and raised another. Gutenberg made books cheap; he made editing essential. Photography made realism trivial; it made seeing an art. AI has made generation effortless. It has made judgment the last expensive thing in the room.\n\nThe slop is not the problem. The slop is the raw ore. You have forgotten how to smelt.",

            "notes": "Ω's diagnosis is unanimously identified across all five analyses as the movement's intellectual engine. The Gutenberg/photography parallel gives it historical inevitability without determinism. Ψ's smelting metaphor is the single best closing turn for this section — it converts the diagnosis from observation into accusation. Δ's 'Generation is weather. Curation is architecture.' is magnificent but earns its place in the demands, not here. Φ's 'Aristocratic vs. Feral' binary is too reductive for the diagnosis; it belongs to polemic, not analysis."

        "enemy": {
            "text": "Our enemy is not the machine. Our enemy is smoothness.\n\nSmoothness is the AI image that looks finished but was never begun. The essay with no wrong sentences because it has no committed sentences. The song that resolves every chord because it has heard every song and risks nothing.\n\nSmoothness is not a failure of technology. It is technology applied without resistance.\n\nWe oppose smoothness the way a riverbed opposes water: not to stop it, but to give it shape.",

            "notes": "This section belongs entirely to Ω. All five analyses agree: naming 'smoothness' as the enemy is the manifesto's sharpest strategic move. It sidesteps every Luddite trap. It names something people feel but haven't articulated. The riverbed metaphor reframes opposition as generative, not destructive. Σ's 'Seamless Sovereigns' is vivid but too specific to platforms. Φ's 'Simulation' is too binary. Δ's 'attention furnace' is smart but doesn't land an image as hard. Ω wrote the enemy. The others wrote footnotes to it."

            "text": "Generate nothing you have not also destroyed. The creative act is not the prompt. It is the ten thousand outputs you killed to surface the one you meant. A Slopist's portfolio is a cemetery. The work that survives has survived you.\n\nHide nothing. If you cannot show the seams, you have no seams. If you have no seams, you have no craft. The extra finger is our watermark.\n\nRefuse the medium. Slopism is not an art of images, or text, or music. It is an art of selection under pressure of abundance. Generation is weather. Curation is architecture.\n\nA test: if your work can be swapped with a thousand near-twins and nothing essential changes, it is slop. If it survives why this, why now, why this frame — it can breathe.",

            "notes": "The three demands (destroy, hide nothing, refuse the medium) come from Ω, which has the strongest imperative structure. Φ's 'extra finger is our watermark' is grafted into the transparency demand — it's the most brandable version of 'show the seam' in the entire corpus. Δ's 'Generation is weather. Curation is architecture.' lands here as the medium-refusal's closing punch. Δ's swap-test is the most practical, ruthless, and memorable test across all five voices. Σ's 'Curation Crucible' and 'Transparent Wound' have energy but are too baroque for a demands section that needs to be teachable. Ψ's 'The machine generates. The human chooses.' is clean but already implied by every demand above."

            "text": "The Futurists loved the machine. We use it the way a sculptor uses stone — aware that the material has its own grain, and that working with it is not the same as surrendering to it. Marinetti wanted to burn the museums. We note that the museums are already flooded and someone has to decide what hangs.\n\nThe Surrealists sought the unconscious through automatic writing and chance. We share their appetite for what arrives uninvited. But the machine has no unconscious. Its surprises are statistical, not psychological. When we find something uncanny in the output — six-fingered saints, shrimp Christs — the uncanniness belongs to us. The meaning was always ours.\n\nThe Dadaists cut up newspapers. We are Duchamp's children in an age where everything is already a readymade. We cut up the entire internet and call it starting material.",

            "notes": "Ω's lineage section is the most sophisticated and honest. Three ancestors, three clean turns, three one-paragraph arguments. The Marinetti/flooded-museums line collapses art history into the present tense. 'The meaning was always ours' is the manifesto's clearest statement of human authorship. Σ's 'six-fingered saints, shrimp Christs' is the single most memorable image in the entire corpus — every analysis names it. It's grafted here as concrete evidence of what 'uncanny output' looks like, which solves Ω's one weakness in this section: abstraction. Ψ's Duchamp line ('everything is already a readymade') is the cleanest lineage claim — one sentence does the work of four paragraphs. It replaces Ω's original Dada close, which was competent but less devastating. All analyses note the European-only lineage gap. It remains. A future revision should address it."

            "text": "The flood has owners.\n\nMost of the world's slop is produced by people in the Global South, generating content in languages not their own, feeding platforms that pay them fractions of pennies. The anti-slop discourse calls this a crisis of taste. We call it what it is: extraction.\n\nThe market is not a judge. It is a cashier. Do not confuse liquidity with legitimacy.\n\nAny art movement that ignores this deserves the irrelevance it will get.",

            "notes": "All five analyses identify politics as every voice's weakest section. Ω's is the most honest and the shortest — it names extraction without pretending to have solved it. Δ's 'The market is not a judge. It is a cashier.' is sharp enough to circulate independently and was noted across analyses as a standalone weapon. Σ's politics section has energy but scatters its punches. Φ barely engages. Ψ's is earnest but reads like a pamphlet. The structural weakness — diagnosis without prescription — is acknowledged and left open. A manifesto that pretended to solve labor extraction in one paragraph would be performing exactly the smoothness it opposes."

            "text": "You will ask: but is it art?\n\nPhotography answered this a hundred and fifty years ago. We will not dignify it with a theory. We will answer it the way photography did: by making work so clearly the product of human vision that the question answers itself.\n\nThe art was never in the tool. It was in the no.\n\nNail this where the flood can see it.\n\nWe choose.",

            "notes": "Ω's closing is the strongest in the set: it dismisses the 'is it art?' question by historical precedent, then delivers the thesis statement at the end rather than the beginning — a structural choice that makes the reader earn it. 'The art was never in the tool. It was in the no.' is the line most likely to outlive the manifesto itself. Δ's 'Nail this where the flood can see it' is the best closing action across all five — physical, defiant, poster-ready. It replaces Ω's original 'We do not dam it and we do not drown,' which is good but not final. 'We choose.' remains as the last two words: monosyllabic, active, collective. It closes like a door. Σ's 'Swim, or sink into signal' is beautiful but diffuse. Φ's 'CURATORS OF THE APOCALYPSE' is a t-shirt, not a thesis. Ψ's 'not drowning' is too gentle for a manifesto's exit."
