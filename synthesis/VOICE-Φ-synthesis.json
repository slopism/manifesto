We see a quarry.\n\nWe do not intend to drink from the deluge. We intend to build with it. We are not here to clean the internet; we are here to make a practice inside the ruin.",

            "text": "Here is the century's problem: The cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not. It has never been higher.\n\nThe generators never sleep. They give us everything we ask for, and that is the catastrophe. The slop is not the problem; the slop is the raw ore. The problem is that you have forgotten how to smelt.\n\nSlopism is the movement that takes judgment seriously, precisely because the machine cannot.",

It is the essay with no wrong sentences because it has no committed sentences. It is the attention furnace that pays for volume and punishes care.\n\nWe declare war on the simulation. We despise the synthetic that tries to pass as a photograph. Do not domesticate the beast; we want the beast wild. We oppose smoothness the way a riverbed opposes water: not to stop it, but to give it shape.",

If you cannot name what you cut, you did not make a work. You opened a tap.\n\n2. GENERATE NOTHING YOU HAVE NOT ALSO DESTROYED.\n   A Slopist's portfolio is a cemetery. The work that survives has survived you.\n\n3. CROWN THE TURDS.\n   Machines belch six-fingered saints, shrimp Christs, and hallucinations of history. Do not polish them. The extra finger is our watermark. If your work can be swapped with a thousand near-twins and nothing essential changes, it is slop.\n\n4. SHOW THE SEAM.\n   Transparency is provenance.

The Surrealists sought the unconscious; we know the machine has no unconscious—its surprises are statistical, not psychological. When we find something uncanny in the output, the uncanniness belongs to us.\n\nWe cut up the entire internet and call it starting material.",
