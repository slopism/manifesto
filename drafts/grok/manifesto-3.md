### SL OPISM MANIFESTO

We declare war on the clean lie. The seamless skin of your AI ad, your viral ghost, your boardroom hallucination—tear it open. Let the wires bleed. Slopism is the movement that eats the flood and spits out fangs. Born from the sewer of 2025's word-of-the-year wreckage, we reclaim the slur not as defeat, but as shrapnel. Slop is the raw ore of tomorrow's blade. The critics wail of drowned signal? We swim in it, gulping the muck to forge new lungs.

Our enemy is the Invisible Hand that strokes the machine into silence. The platform lords who algorithm us into cat-vomiting kittens for clicks, the venture vampires sucking datasets from forgotten dancers' graves, the purist priests hoarding "soul" like a miser's coin while their canvases gather dust. They peddle deception as progress: AI art so polished it passes for breath, fooling the eye into forgetting the grindstone. We name them: the Enshittifiers, those who flood the world with anonymous effluent to starve the human spark. Their slop is theft without confession—stolen limbs reassembled in the dark, sold as salvation. We oppose them with exposure, turning their deluge against the dam.

From the avant-garde we steal fire, not blueprints. Futurism's roar of pistons and peril—we take the velocity, the gleeful demolition of the old husk, but hurl their war-lust into the trash-compactor of history. No more manifestos marching to mass graves; our speed is the stutter of servers overheating, not boots on necks. Dada's razor-laugh at meaning's corpse? We sharpen it on silicon edges, amplifying the absurd to planetary scale—Shrimp Jesus not as joke, but as oracle, his claws prying open the code's hypocrisy. Surrealism's dream-dive into the id's slime—we mechanize it, not to mimic the psyche's whisper, but to drown in its echo chamber, where prompts birth chimeras that mock the dreamer's tidy Freud. We add the glitch as sacrament: the extra thumb, the melting clockface smeared with metadata. Not rejection, but remix—the lineage is a chain we drag through the mud, links reforged in the furnace of abundance.

Slopism lives in the three fractures where human meets machine, and we hammer them into axioms:

**I. The Curation Crucible.** Generation is the beast's belch—endless, indifferent, a billion variants of the same wilted rose. Creation ignites when the human hand dips in, not to polish, but to maim: select the malformed, chain the discards into litanies, force the overflow into confession. The line is drawn in refusal: we curate not for beauty, but for bruise. Your prompt is prayer; our edit is exorcism. Without this alchemy, abundance is just avalanche—burying us alive. With it, slop becomes scaffold, the human the scaffold's saboteur.

**II. The Transparency Forge.** Deception is the Enshittifier's venom—seamless fakes that breed doubt's plague, turning every image into a liar's wink. We demand the autopsy: watermark the wound, log the prompt like a murderer's diary, exhibit the failure stack as fresco. Transparency is not footnote; it's the frame, the flesh peeled back to show the pistons pumping. Hide nothing, or you're no Slopist—you're just another ghost in the gallery. In this glare, the machine's limits become our lore: errors as epitaphs, datasets as dirges sung aloud.

**III. The Medium Maelstrom.** Slopism scorns the cage of canvas or code. It is the pact between judgment and jetsam, unbound by pixel or page—applicable to the holograms of 2040, the neural symphonies yet unborn, the scent-sculptures of fever dreams. In poetry, we sift sonnets from static; in flesh, we tattoo the algorithm's stutter. The movement devours mediums whole, regurgitating them hybrid: human hunger feasting on machine excess. No silos, no safe harbors—only the roil where intent wrestles infinity.

To the discourse's dirge—you who tally the hollow tracks on Deezer, the zombie reels on TikTok, the burnout of artists edged out by IP grave-robbers—we say: your fatigue is fuel. The dead internet? We necromance it, raising slop's horde not to conquer, but to carnival. The optimists' "it'll get better" is sedative; the critics' purity spiral, a noose. Slopism threads the needle: we don't fix the flood, we flood the fixers. Platforms reward quantity? We queer it with quality's corpse-dance. Global sweat-farms churning for Western scrolls? We amplify their glitches into global guillotines, turning outsourced slop into solidarity's shiv.

Join us or choke on the clean. Nail this to your screen, your studio door, your neural implant. Slopism is not invitation—it's infiltration. We are the overflow you can't scroll past. In the belly of the beast, we build the mouth that bites back.
