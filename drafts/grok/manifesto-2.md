### SLOPISM MANIFESTO

We declare war on the clean lie. The glossy veil of progress that smothers the glitch, the prompt scar, the six-fingered hand waving from the canvas. Slopism rises from the effluent: not as apology, but as insurrection. We are the dredgers, the alchemists of overflow. AI floods the world with its billion-eyed vomit—Shrimp Jesus crucified on a bed of algorithms, kitten-vending machines birthing furred abominations—and we say: *Good*. Let it choke the pipes. Let it stain the walls. This is our raw ore.

From the avant-garde crypt, we plunder what serves and torch the rest. Futurism's engine-roar? We steal it, throttle up: machines as berserkers, smashing the museum's marble hush. But we spit on their war-lust, their cockpit fascism—velocity without venom. Dada's razor-laugh at sense? Ours, amplified: we collage the corpse of coherence, but refuse their despair; our nonsense builds barricades, not bonfires. Surrealism's dream-thief? We claim the automatism, but hijack the wheel—Breton's velvet knife now hacks the neural net, spilling not subconscious syrup but code-blood confessions. What we add: the fork in the flood. Human hand on the lever, steering the deluge toward dawn. No more lone geniuses starving in garrets. Slopism is the swarm's symphony: abundance as arsenal.

The enemy? The Seamless Swindlers. Those boardroom sorcerers peddling AI as invisible ink—polished propaganda for the scroll-zombies, fake smiles in McDonald's fever-dream ads, novels stitched from stolen spines to clog Amazon's veins. They birth slop in secret, for profit's quiet harvest: dopamine farms where gig-ghosts in Mumbai sweat prompts for Midwestern clicks, while purist priests wail from ivory towers, clutching their "soul" like a talisman against the tide. Both sides collude in the con—one hides the machine to hoard the gold, the other exiles it to preserve the shrine. They fear the flood because it drowns their monopolies: the elite's authenticity racket, the tech-lord's deception derby. We expose them both. Slopism names the grime they deny.

**Tension One: The Fork in the Flood.** Generation is the machine's gasp—endless, indifferent, a firehose of maybes. Curation? That's our blade: the instant we plunge in, sift the silt for shrapnel, weld the wreckage into weapons. The line falls where intent ignites. Not every prompt is creation; it's the cull, the twist, the *why* that forges art from effluent. We don't generate; we *garner*. Turn the torrent to torchlight. A thousand Shrimp Jesuses? We crown one king, dethrone the rest. This is no lazy harvest—it's the labor of lovers in a landfill, kissing rust into roses.

**Tension Two: Scars as Scripture.** Transparency is our gospel, etched in error. No sleight-of-hand polish; we parade the seams. Publish the prompt-logs like war diaries, watermark the whimsy with glitch-gospels—extra limbs as laurels, syntax stutters as stigmata. Deception is the swindler's shroud; we rip it ragged. Let the viewer trace the veins back to the voltage. In this nakedness, truth ferments: the machine's mimicry mocked, its theft tallied, our triumph tattooed. Hide nothing, and the flood loses its fangs—becomes mirror, not mask.

**Tension Three: Posture for the Unborn.** Slopism bows to no canvas, no codec. It's the hunch of the hunter in the data-deluge: human judgment lashed to machine excess, a compass for chaos. Text? We slop sonnets from syllable-shards. Sound? Symphonies scraped from sample-sludge. Tomorrow's mediums—neural implants, quantum quilts—we claim them too. This is posture, not palette: the eternal crouch before the wave, ready to ride or redirect. Mediums mutate; the method endures. We prepare the pirates for ports uncharted.

To the discourse's dirge—your anti-slop elegies, your pro-AI pablum—we howl back: enough mourning the mess you've made. History's script repeats: print's penny-dreadfuls birthed ballads that outlasted bishops; nickelodeon's nickel-trash trained the silver screen's savants. Slop isn't apocalypse—it's the apprentice phase, the B-movie bootcamp where we learn to wield the wild. Critics, your "dead pulse" whine ignores the heartbeat in the heap: outsourced drudges finding voice in viral absurdities, neurodiverse minds mapping concepts no hand could sketch. Platforms? Starve their bait with our badges of origin. Purists? Join or jettison—authenticity was always illusion; now it's augmentation.

Slopists, arise. Nail this to the server rack, the studio wall, the blockchain's brittle hide. Dive the drain, drag up the dazzle. We are not victims of the valve; we are its vandals. In the slop, we see our sea—vast, vile, vital. Swim it. Shape it. Sing it.
