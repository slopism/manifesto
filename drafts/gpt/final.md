### Evaluation (brutal)

* **On a wall:** **Manifesto 3**. It is built from hard theses, not paragraphs, and it ends with an actual wall-instruction. 
* **Stops mid-scroll:** **Manifesto 2**. The opening cadence (“Images with no witness…”) and the “They use ‘slop’…” repetition is the best hook. 
* **Most quotable lines:** **Manifesto 3** has the highest quote-density (“publication without judgment,” “the cut,” “weather/architecture”). 
* **Best balance (art history + philosophy + punch):** **Manifesto 2** is the most complete argument with clean lineage placement, but it drifts into essay-mode in places. 
* **Best format for this content:** **Short hook + numbered theses** (Manifesto 3). This topic is about refusal, cuts, constraints, provenance. It should read like a set of blades. 

### Pick

**Manifesto 3** is the strongest base because it is the most “manifesto-shaped”: dense, declarative, and built to be quoted and reposted.

## FINAL MANIFESTO (tightened from Manifesto 3) 

# SLOPISM

## A manifesto for judgment in the flood

We live under a flood of finished-looking mediocrity.
Not a style. An economic weapon: minutes to generate, hours to verify, filter, forget.
The feed rewards the cheapest signal and calls it culture.

Stop asking whether the machine feels.
Ask what you chose, what you refused, and what you will answer for.

Slop is not “AI-made.” Slop is publication without judgment.

1. **Generation is weather. Curation is architecture.**
   The model rains. It will keep raining. Art begins when abundance is forced into shape.

2. **Creation begins at the first no.**
   If you cannot name what you cut, you did not make a work. You opened a tap.

3. **The unit of Slopism is the cut.**
   Not the prompt. Not the output. The cut: sequence, frame, path through the graph. A Slopist signs in decisions.

4. **Constraint is our signature.**
   We starve infinity on purpose. Hard limits, hostile rules, blind collaboration, time delays, rituals that make choice visible.

5. **Transparency is provenance.**
   Do not hide the engine. Do not counterfeit witness. If a voice is simulated, say so. If a scene never happened, do not dress it in documentary light. Show the seam. When in doubt, label the spell.

6. **Deception is theft of attention.**
   Fake evidence. Synthetic intimacy. Anonymous floods that cannot be questioned. Outside us.

7. **Our enemy is the attention furnace.**
   The incentive system that pays for volume and punishes care, then calls the landfill “the future.”

8. **We refuse the cult of speed.**
   Futurism mistook the engine for the poem. We keep the machine and drop the worship. We refuse the morality of more. We practice the dignity of enough.

9. **We practice synthetic automatism, then we wake up.**
   Surrealism sought the sentence beneath reason. Dada cut the newspaper. We let the model spill, then we do the human task: selection, naming, context, responsibility. The machine can improvise. Only a person can mean it.

10. **The market is not a judge. It is a cashier.**
    Do not confuse liquidity with legitimacy.

11. **Slopism is not a medium. It is a relationship.**
    Wherever generation is cheap, the work is the same: carve meaning out of surplus, build forms that resist replacement.

12. **A test.**
    If your work can be swapped with a thousand near-twins and nothing essential changes, it is slop. If it survives “why this, why now, why this frame,” it can breathe.

We are not here to clean the internet. We are here to make a practice inside the ruin.

Slop is cheap. Judgment is not.

Nail this where the flood can see it.

### Brief note (<=100 words)

I picked **Manifesto 3** because it is the most poster-ready: maximum compression, minimum explanation, and multiple lines that survive extraction.  I cut soft qualifiers, removed redundancy, tightened each thesis into a single strike, and clarified the platform-native idea of “path through the graph” without turning it into product copy. I also sharpened the ethics section so “provenance” and “deception” read like boundaries, not advice. Strongest line: **“The unit of Slopism is the cut.”**
