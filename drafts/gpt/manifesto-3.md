SLOPISM

We live under a flood of finished-looking mediocrity. It is not a style. It is an economic weapon: minutes to generate, hours to verify, filter, forget. The feed rewards the cheapest signal and calls it culture. 

We refuse to argue about whether the machine “feels.” That is a parlor game for people who still think the question is “AI or not.” The question is: what did you choose, what did you refuse, and what will you answer for.

Slop is not “AI-made.” Slop is publication without judgment.

1. Generation is weather. Curation is architecture.
   The model rains. It always will. Art begins when someone builds a roof, a gutter, a canal, a ruin. Art begins when abundance is forced through a shape.

2. Creation begins at the first no.
   If you cannot name the moment you rejected nine hundred acceptable outputs, you did not make a work. You opened a tap.

3. The unit of Slopism is the cut.
   Not the image. Not the paragraph. Not the prompt. The cut. The sequence. The frame. The path. A Slopist signs with decisions.

4. Constraint is our signature, not our apology.
   We take the machine’s infinity and we starve it on purpose. We use hard limits, hostile rules, blind collaboration, time delays, weird rituals. We do this to make choice visible.

5. Transparency is not confession. It is provenance.
   Do not hide the engine. Do not counterfeit witness. If a voice is simulated, say so. If a scene never happened, do not dress it in documentary light. Show the scaffolding when the scaffolding is the point. When in doubt, label the spell.

6. Deception is not a genre. It is theft of attention.
   We reject the fake that pretends to be evidence. We reject the anonymous flood that cannot be questioned. We reject the deepfake used as a club and the chatbot used as a mask.

7. Our enemy is the attention furnace.
   Not the tool. Not the kid making their first ugly picture. Not the medium. The enemy is the incentive system that pays for volume and punishes care, then calls the resulting landfill “the future.”

8. We do not worship acceleration.
   Futurism loved speed and mistook the engine for the poem. We keep the machine, we drop the worship. We refuse the morality of “more.” We practice the dignity of “enough.”

9. We practice a new automatism, then we wake up.
   Surrealism hunted the sentence beneath reason. Dada cut and shuffled the newspaper. We let the model spill its dream-sediment, then we do the human task: selection, naming, context, responsibility. The machine can improvise. Only a person can mean it.

10. The market is not a judge. It is a cashier.
    An auction can price anything. It cannot tell you what survived. Do not confuse liquidity with legitimacy.

11. Slopism is not a medium. It is a relationship.
    Text, image, sound, code, performance, future senses we have not named yet. Wherever generation is cheap, the act is the same: to carve meaning out of surplus, to build a form that resists replacement.

12. A test.
    If your work can be swapped with a thousand near-twins and nothing essential changes, it is slop. If the primary cleverness is that it fooled a feed, it is slop. If the meaning survives the question “why this, why now, why this framing,” then it can breathe.

We are not here to clean the internet. We are here to make a practice inside the ruin.

Slopism is the art of deliberate friction in the age of effortless output.
Slopism is the refusal to let abundance decide for us.
Slopism is the proof that judgment still exists.

Nail this where the flood can see it.
