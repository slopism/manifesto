## SLOPISM: A Manifesto for Judgment in the Age of Abundance

1. The machine has made a new substance: infinite, fluent, finished-looking output. It is cheap enough to become weather.

2. The flood is not art. The flood is an incentives machine. It turns attention into money and meaning into exhaust.

3. We name our movement after the insult because the insult is accurate. Most of what will be generated will be waste. We do not deny this. We weaponize the admission.

4. Slop is not “made with AI.” Slop is what happens when near-zero effort is injected into markets that reward volume. Slop is content that exists because it can exist.

5. The enemy is not the model. The enemy is the feed. The enemy is distribution without consent. The enemy is the algorithmic doctrine that more is always better.

6. We do not worship speed. We do not confuse acceleration with vision. Futurism sang to the engine and forgot who owned it. We refuse that intoxication.

7. We take from Dada the sabotage of seriousness when seriousness becomes propaganda. We take from Surrealism the method of automatism, but we do not romanticize it. Our automatism is synthetic, and that is precisely why it must be judged.

8. Generation is not creation. Generation is raw material. Creation begins at the first refusal.

9. The line is simple: if you can replace the work with a thousand near-variants and nothing important changes, it is slop. If the work collapses when asked “why this, why now, why this form,” it is slop.

10. The Slopist is not a prompter. The Slopist is an editor with a spine. We sculpt by selection, constraint, sequencing, and context. We sign our choices.

11. Curation is not cleanup. Curation is authorship under new physics. When abundance is infinite, meaning is a scarce resource, and scarcity is produced by judgment.

12. Transparency is not a disclaimer hidden in metadata. Transparency is visible structure. Show the machine as machine. Show the seam. Show the constraint. Show the cut.

13. We reject deception in both directions. We reject passing the machine as human. We also reject the performative purity that pretends the machine is not already inside the culture’s bloodstream.

14. In an era where authenticity becomes probabilistic, provenance becomes ethics. The work must carry its lineage of decisions the way an artwork carries brushstrokes. Not as confession, but as responsibility.

15. We demand new frictions. Not censorship, not nostalgia, not gatekeeping. Friction that makes room for meaning: labeling that cannot be sanded off, channels that are opt-in, limits that punish floods, norms that treat publication as a claim, not a reflex.

16. The market will try to baptize anything it can sell. We are not impressed by auction lights. Liquidity is not legitimacy. A price is not a proof.

17. Slopism is not a style. It is a relationship between human judgment and machine abundance that can inhabit any medium: image, text, sound, game, ritual, interface, forms not yet invented.

18. Our artworks will often look like systems because that is where the frontier moved. The frame is no longer only a rectangle. It is a graph, a path, a rule-set, a living archive. The human act is what holds it together.

19. We make work that resists the feed’s demand for instant comprehension. We make work that cannot be “understood at a glance” because the glance is the feed’s unit of profit.

20. We declare a new literacy. Do not ask first, “was it generated?” Ask, “was it chosen?” Ask, “what was refused?” Ask, “what did the human risk?” Ask, “what does this cost to see, to feel, to verify, to carry?”

21. Slopism is the opposite of flooding. Slopism is the discipline of not posting. Slopism is the right to remain silent until the cut is real.

22. If the age is condemned to abundance, then judgment becomes the last human luxury and the first human duty. We will not outsource it.
