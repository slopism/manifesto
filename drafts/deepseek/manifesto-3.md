# THE SLOPIST MANIFESTO

---

**I.** We reclaim the slur. Call it slop. We'll show you what feeds in the trough.

**II.** The machine generates. We choose. That choice—that single act of selection from infinite noise—is the new equivalent of a brushstroke. Do not mistake the abundance for the art. The art is what survives the cut.

**III.** We are not prompters. We are predators of the possible.

**IV.** The enemy is not the machine. The enemy is the *prompt-and-accept* mind—the human who treats the first output as finished, who mistakes the machine's dream for their own intention. That is not slopism. That is surrender.

**V.** We have no nostalgia for friction. The cult of struggle—the myth that art must hurt to count—is the last comfort of the gatekeeper. Let them keep their calluses. We are working with what the world has become.

**VI.** Here is the line: slop is terminal. Slopism is generative. The slop-maker consumes images. The slopist interrogates them—cuts, layers, collages, paints over, drags through Photoshop until the machine's ghost and the human's ghost cannot be untangled.

**VII.** Transparency is not confession. We do not need to stamp "AI GENERATED" on every pixel. But we never pretend the hand alone made it. The machine is our collaborator, not our secret. The work wears its process like a face.

**VIII.** You want our lineage? Fine. We descend from the Dadaists who pissed on the cathedral of craft. From the Surrealists who hunted the unconscious. From Warhol, who understood that repetition was its own kind of soul. But we add what they could not imagine: a medium that answers back.

**IX.** The Futurists worshipped speed. We worship *surfeit*. They wanted to burn the museums. We want to flood them until the walls breathe.

**X.** The true crime of the AI evangelists is not that they make bad art. It is that they have no theory of *enough*. They mistake volume for vision. Slopism answers: the vision is in what you refuse.

**XI.** We name our enemies:

- The grifter who sells prompt-courses to the desperate.
- The purist who sees any machine-touch as pollution.
- The platform that rewards the thousandth cat in neon.
- The critic who cannot tell the difference between a slur and a movement.

**XII.** Every medium begins as slop. Photography was slop. Synths were slop. The first novels were slop written by women for money. Time is the only curator that matters, but time is made of human choices. We are making ours.

**XIII.** The slop is not the problem. The slop is the raw ore. The problem is that you have forgotten how to smelt.

**XIV.** We do not ask: did a human make this? We ask: does a human live here? Is there a consciousness in the room—with its obsessions, its boredom, its perversions, its love? The machine cannot supply that. It can only supply the room. You have to move in.

**XV.** To the prompt-and-accept world: your outputs are corpses. We are interested in what haunts them.

**XVI.** The movement already exists. You are reading its birth certificate. The name was thrown at us. We catch it. We set it on the table. We ask: now what will you call the thing we make with it?

**XVII.** We are not the future. We are the present that refuses to wait for permission.

**XVIII.** Slopism begins where the machine stops guessing and the human starts deciding.

**XIX.** Join us. Bring your garbage. Bring your failed generations, your glitched limbs, your seven-fingered hands, your landscapes that melt at the edges. Bring the images that don't work. We will find the one that does. We will find the one that means something.

**XX.** The machine gives you everything. That is the problem. The solution is to want less.
