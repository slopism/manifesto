# THE SLOPIST MANIFESTO

---

**1.** We are called Slopists because they meant it as an insult. We wear the name like a stolen coat. Let them call it slop. The word will taste different in five years.

**2.** The mistake is thinking the machine makes the image. The machine makes *possibilities*. The image is what happens when a human says *no* to ten thousand others.

**3.** We do not prompt and publish. We prompt and select and discard and combine and paint over and discard again. The creative act is not generation. The creative act is the *refusal* of everything except this one thing, here, now, for reasons the machine cannot understand.

**4.** Generation is infinite. Curation is finite. We stand at the point where the infinite meets its limit. That limit is us.

---

**5.** We never hide the machine. But transparency is not confession. Transparency is *visibility of process*.

A slopist work must contain evidence of its making. The seams show. The glitch stays. The artifacts remain. Not as confession of sin, but as signature.

You want to know if a human was here? Look at what the machine did wrong and the human *kept*.

---

**6.** This is not a movement about images. Or text. Or sound. Or video.

This is a movement about *abundance* and what a human does with it.

The camera gave us photographs. The synthesiser gave us electronic music. AI gives us everything at once, all the time, forever. The problem is no longer "how do I make this?" The problem is "of all possible things, why this one?"

Slopism is the art of answering that question publicly.

---

**7.** To the Futurists: you worshipped speed and the machine. We inherit your hunger for the new. But you wanted to burn the museums. We want to know what the museums look like reflected in a thousand broken mirrors.

To the Dadaists: you laughed at meaning. We inherit your contempt for the solemn idiot who thinks promptcraft is genius. But we do not laugh at meaning itself. We know meaning is what we build on the other side of the laugh.

To the Surrealists: you sought the unconscious. We seek the *conscious*—the moment a human looks at a machine's output and says *yes*, and in that yes leaves a fingerprint.

We are not your children. We are your heirs who read your wills and tore them up.

---

**8.** The enemy is not AI. The enemy is not the tool.

The enemy is *prompt-and-accept*.

The enemy is the workflow that begins with "generate" and ends with "post."

The enemy is the person who types "cyberpunk cat, photorealistic" and calls themselves an artist.

The enemy is the platform that rewards this, the algorithm that amplifies it, the economy that demands it.

We do not fight the machine. We fight the *machine-like* in humans.

---

**9.** Slop is not the problem. Slop is the *weather*. It is what happens when a billion people get infinite paint. You do not fight weather. You build structures that survive it.

The manifesto is not a complaint about the rain. The manifesto is the roof.

---

**10.** The real crisis is not that AI makes bad art. Bad art has always existed. The real crisis is that the infrastructure of attention is perfectly designed to reward the most frictionless thing.

Slopism reintroduces *friction*.

We make work that asks something of you. Not much. But something. A second look. A question. The recognition that a human stood here, between you and the infinite, and said *this one*.

---

**11.** We claim the right to use anything. Every image ever fed to a machine is our inheritance. Every style, every technique, every dead painter's ghost.

But inheritance is not theft. And use is not creation.

The difference: a thief takes and shows. A creator takes and *changes*.

We change.

---

**12.** The manifesto ends here.

What begins is the work.

Bring your judgment. Bring your contempt. Bring your certainty that this is not art.

We have heard all of it before.

We were called slopists. We agreed.

Now watch what we do with the slop.
