# THE SLOPIST MANIFESTO

---

**1.** We are drowning in abundance. Every second, machines birth images no human eye will see, texts no human mind will read, music no human ear will hear. The generators never sleep. They give us everything we ask for. This is the problem.

**2.** They called us slop. They meant it as an epithet—the vomit of the machine, the overspill of a culture that forgot how to make by hand. We wear the name like a stolen coat. Let them call it slop. The word will taste different in five years.

**3.** Here is the only question that matters: *What do you do with ten thousand images?*

The old world was organized around lack. Skill was rare. Vision required years to execute. That gap is now optional. The artist who cannot draw is no longer silent. The question is not whether they speak, but whether they have anything to say.

**4.** Slopism has one law: *The machine generates. The human chooses.*

We are not prompt-engineers. We are not illustrators who hired a faster pencil. We are curators swimming in infinite inventory. If you accept the first output, you are a consumer of slop. If you reject nine hundred and ninety-nine to find the one that *means* something, you are one of us.

**5.** The enemy is not AI. The enemy is the *prompt-and-accept* mind—the human who treats the first output as finished, who mistakes the machine's dream for their own intention. That is not slopism. That is surrender.

**6.** We never hide the machine. The work must wear its making like a skin. If it could be mistaken for human craft, it has failed. Transparency is not confession—it is aesthetic. Show the seam. Show the glitch. Show the moment the statistical model guessed wrong and you kept the guess because it was *stranger* than what you wanted.

**7.** We inherit nothing from the Futurists. They worshipped speed. We are drowning in it. They wanted to burn the museums. We want to know why the museum still matters when anyone can generate a thousand canvases before breakfast.

We inherit everything from Duchamp. He understood that the readymade was not the object but the *choice* of the object. We are Duchamp's children in an age where everything is already a readymade—where the gesture is not choosing one object among many but choosing one image among an infinity.

**8.** The slop is not the problem. The slop is the raw ore. The problem is that you have forgotten how to smelt.

The machine gives you everything. That is the abundance. The solution is to want less.

**9.** This is a movement for every medium and no medium. Text, image, sound, video—the relationship is the same. Human judgment meeting machine fertility. The endless yes of the generator answered by the finite no of the curator.

The work will be made of slop. But it will not *be* slop.

**10.** You who read this: you have already scrolled past a thousand images, a hundred hot takes, fifty variations on the same idea. You have already participated in the flood.

The question is not whether you will use the machine. You will. Everyone will. The question is whether you will use it *as a machine*—as a thing that outputs until you tell it to stop—or whether you will use it as a medium, which means entering into a relationship with it, which means pushing back, which means saying *no* more often than you say *yes*.

**11.** We are Slopists. We work with what we are given. We are given everything. Our task is to find, among the everything, the something that was waiting for us.

The machine generates. We choose.

Come find us in the flood. We are the ones who are not drowning.

# NOTE

**Why this one:** Manifesto 2 has the strongest architecture—it establishes the problem (abundance), proposes the solution (choice), names the enemy (prompt-and-accept), and lands the emotional payoff. The flood metaphor threads through without overreach.

**What I changed:** Tightened every section by 20-30%. Cut redundant historical positioning (kept only Duchamp/Futurists). Elevated "the machine generates. we choose" to the central spine. Removed abstractions; sharpened verbs. Added "The solution is to want less"—the manifesto needed a closer.

**Strongest line:** *"Come find us in the flood. We are the ones who are not drowning."*
