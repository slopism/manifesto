# THE SLOPIST MANIFESTO

---

**1.**

We are drowning in abundance. This is not a metaphor. Every second, machines birth images no human eye will ever see, texts no human mind will ever read, music no human ear will ever hear. The generators never sleep. They have no bodies to tire, no hands to cramp, no mortality to hurry them along.

They give us everything we ask for. This is the problem.

**2.**

They called us slop. They meant it as an epithet—the vomit of the machine, the overspill of a culture that forgot how to make anything by hand. They pointed at the flood and said: *this is what you are.*

Yes. We are the flood. We are what happens when creation loses its scarcity.

And we are what happens next.

**3.**

Here is the only question that matters: *What do you do with ten thousand images?*

The old world was organized around lack. Skill was rare. Vision required years to execute. The gap between wanting to say something and being able to say it was the space where craft lived. That gap is now optional.

The artist who cannot draw is no longer silent. The question is not whether they speak, but whether they have anything to say.

**4.**

Slopism has one law: *The machine generates. The human chooses.*

That is not a slogan. It is a description of labor. Our work begins where the generator stops. We are not prompt-engineers. We are not illustrators who hired a faster pencil. We are curators swimming in infinite inventory, selecting what matters from what merely exists.

The line between generation and creation is drawn by *intent*. If you accept the first output, you are a consumer of slop. If you reject nine hundred and ninety-nine to find the one that *means* something, you are one of us.

**5.**

We never hide the machine. The work must wear its making like a skin. If it could be mistaken for human craft, it has failed. Transparency is not a ethical position—it is an aesthetic one. The friction between human intention and machine probability is where our beauty lives. Smooth that friction away and you have nothing but a cheaper photograph, a faster painting, a lazier poem.

Show the seam. Show the glitch. Show the moment where the statistical model guessed wrong and you kept the guess because it was *stranger* than what you wanted.

**6.**

We inherit nothing from the Futurists. They worshipped speed. We are drowning in it. They wanted to smash the museums. We want to know why the museum still matters when anyone can generate a thousand canvases before breakfast. They celebrated the machine as the extension of human will. We live in the aftermath of that extension, picking through what the machine left behind.

We inherit everything from Duchamp. He understood that the readymade was not the object but the *choice* of the object. The urinal was not art. The gesture of placing it in a gallery was art. We are Duchamp's children in an age where everything is already a readymade, where the entire history of human making is available as raw material, where the gesture is not choosing one object among many but choosing one image among an infinity.

**7.**

The enemy is not the machine. The enemy is not the artist who fears us. The enemy is not the critic who named us.

The enemy is *prompt-and-accept*. The enemy is the user who types "cyberpunk cat, photorealistic" and posts the first result. The enemy is the mindset that treats the generator as a vending machine for dopamine. The enemy is the belief that because something can be made instantly, it should be.

We are not against abundance. We are against abundance without discernment. We are not against speed. We are against speed without friction. We are not against the machine. We are against the human who abdicates to it.

**8.**

This is a movement for every medium and no medium. Text, image, sound, video, the forms we cannot yet name—the relationship is the same. Human judgment meeting machine fertility. The endless yes of the generator answered by the finite no of the curator.

The work will be made of slop. But it will not *be* slop.

**9.**

You who read this: you have already generated. You have already scrolled past a thousand images, a hundred hot takes, fifty variations on the same idea. You have already participated in the flood.

The question is not whether you will use the machine. You will. Everyone will. The question is whether you will use it *as a machine*—as a thing that outputs until you tell it to stop—or whether you will use it as a medium, which means entering into a relationship with it, which means pushing back, which means saying *no* more often than you say *yes*.

**10.**

We are Slopists. We work with what we are given. We are given everything. Our task is to find, among the everything, the something that was waiting for us.

The machine generates. We choose.

Come find us in the flood. We are the ones who are not drowning.
