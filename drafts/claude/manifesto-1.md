# THE SLOPIST MANIFESTO

The flood is here. It will not recede.

Every platform, every feed, every inbox fills with the smooth and the finished — images no one intended, texts no one needed, music no one will remember past the length of its playing. A quarter-billion outputs a day and climbing. The machines are generous. They give us everything and mean nothing by it.

We do not oppose the flood. We are not Luddites and we are not priests. We have no interest in defending the old scarcities — the guild, the gallery, the gatekeeper who confused craft with permission. Those walls kept more people out than they kept quality in. Good riddance.

But we do not celebrate the flood either. We refuse the Silicon Valley hymn that abundance is inherently democratic, that more is freer, that a tool which collapses the cost of making to zero has thereby liberated making. That is the language of the margin, not the muse. A Kenyan content farmer generating Jesus images for Facebook ad revenue is not liberated. He is arbitraged. The flood has its own class system, and it flows downhill.

**We are the ones who stand in the water and choose.**

This is the act: not generation, but selection. Not prompting, but judging. The machine offers ten thousand images. The Slopist keeps one — or none — or takes the worst and asks *why does this fail, and what does the failure show me?* The creative act has migrated. It no longer lives in the hand. It lives in the eye, the ear, the willingness to reject abundance and find what means.

We take the name they gave us. *Slop*: Merriam-Webster's word of the year, spoken with contempt by people who have never looked closely at what contempt conceals. The Impressionists were named by a hostile critic. The Fauves were called wild beasts. We are called slop merchants, and we say: yes. We work in slop the way a sculptor works in marble — not because the material is precious, but because the cutting is. What you remove is the art.

**On our lineage.** We descend from everyone who made art by taking what already existed and deciding what it meant.

Duchamp put a urinal in a gallery and called it a fountain. We put a machine's output in a frame and call it a choice. The gesture rhymes. But Duchamp's readymade was singular — one object, one act of selection, one scandal. Our readymade arrives at industrial scale. We do not have the luxury of the single gesture. We must choose *repeatedly*, which means we must develop taste, which means we must be willing to be wrong a thousand times in private to be right once in public.

We take from Surrealism the love of the accidental. Breton wanted the unconscious to speak through the hand. The machine has no unconscious — it has a statistical median — but its errors produce the same uncanny electricity that automatic writing once did: the extra finger, the melting jaw, the sentence that almost means something. We use that electricity. We do not pretend it is depth.

We take from Pop the refusal to distinguish high material from low. Warhol silkscreened soup cans. We curate hallucinations.

We refuse Futurism entirely. Marinetti loved the machine for its power. We do not love the machine. We love what happens when a human stands in front of the machine's output and *thinks*. The machine is not our partner. It is our quarry, our terrain, our weather. You do not collaborate with weather. You build in it.

**On our enemy.** We oppose smoothness.

Not ugliness, not shock, not the avant-garde pantomime of transgression. We oppose the specific, lethal smoothness of an output that looks finished before anyone has *finished it*. The AI-generated image that arrives with professional lighting, balanced composition, and no reason to exist. The text that reads like competent prose and says nothing a human risked believing. The song that sounds produced and was never heard. Smoothness is the camouflage of the empty — the algorithm optimizing for the absence of friction, which is to say, optimizing against thought.

We insist on friction. The space between what the machine offers and what the artist keeps — that gap is where meaning lives. Collapse the gap and you have content. Widen it and you have art. The gap is not a flaw in the process. *The gap is the process.*

**To the artists already working in this territory** — training models on *Dance Moms*, drawing out the glitch, composing with the hallucination — you are not alone and you are not confused. You have a name now. Use it or don't. The work was already real.

**To the machines:** Thank you for the material.

We'll take it from here.
