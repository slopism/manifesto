# THE SLOPISM MANIFESTO

### I.

The machine finished everything and no one noticed.

It finished the painting. It finished the essay. It finished the song, the logo, the sonnet, the sermon. It finished them all at once, in seconds, without error, without fatigue, without doubt. And the finished things were smooth as plastic. And the smooth things filled the feed, the inbox, the gallery wall, the search result, the bookshelf, the billboard. And the world grew full of things that looked exactly like art but weighed nothing at all.

We are writing from inside that flood.

### II.

**The enemy is not the machine. The enemy is the smooth.**

Smoothness is the aesthetic of a system that has eliminated every obstacle between prompt and product. Smoothness is what you get when no one struggled, no one chose, no one risked being wrong. Smoothness is competence without consequence. It is the house style of the algorithm: always resolved, never earned.

The Futurists loved the machine for its speed. We do not love the machine. We do not hate it either. We refuse the question. A chisel is not loved or hated. A camera is not loved or hated. The machine is a medium. Worship it and you get Silicon Valley. Fear it and you get nostalgia. Use it and you get art. Maybe. If you are ruthless enough about what you keep.

### III.

Slopism begins where generation ends.

The word *slop* was given as an insult. We take it the way the Impressionists took theirs — from a hostile critic who accidentally named something real. Slop is the raw material: the undifferentiated, the abundant, the too-much. Every medium has its slop. Oil paint is slop before the brush discriminates. Marble is slop before the chisel refuses. Film is slop before the editor cuts.

What is new is the scale. The machine produces slop at a volume no chisel or camera ever could. Good. The Slopist does not flinch at abundance. The Slopist *requires* it — because the art is the act of refusal, and refusal means nothing when there is nothing to refuse.

### IV.

**We hold these things to be necessary:**

That the machine is always visible. Slopism never hides the seam. We do not pass off generation as creation, and we do not permit others to do so in our name. The audience has a right to know what was made and what was chosen. Transparency is not a concession. It is the point. The seam is where the meaning lives.

That curation is creation. Not in the diluted sense — not "everyone is a curator now." In the hard sense: that selecting, sequencing, recontextualizing, and discarding are creative acts as profound as any brushstroke, and that the person who generates ten thousand images and shows you one has made ten thousand decisions, nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine of which were *no*.

That no medium is final. This is not a movement about images. It is not about text. It is about a relationship — human judgment meeting machine abundance — that will outlast every tool that currently exists. Anything that can be generated can be curated. The manifesto holds wherever that is true.

### V.

What we inherit. What we refuse.

From Dada we take the readymade — Duchamp's insistence that choosing is making. From Surrealism we take the appetite for the strange, the glitch, the uncanny — Beth Frey was right that the machine was more interesting when it was worse. From Pop Art we take the refusal to distinguish high from low material. From Hal Foster we take the demand that art reveal its own construction.

From Futurism we take nothing. Marinetti loved the machine the way venture capital loves the machine: as a force that destroys and calls destruction progress. We have seen where that love leads. We are not accelerationists. We are not optimists. We are people with a medium and a practice and no illusions about either.

### VI.

The anti-slop critics are half right.

They are right that most AI output is worthless. They are right that the flood is real and the economic damage is real and the platforms are incentivizing extraction over craft. They are right that smoothness is a disease.

They are wrong that the answer is refusal. They are wrong the way the Académie was wrong about photography — not in their diagnosis but in their prescription. Photography did not kill painting. It killed painting's monopoly on realism, and that was painting's liberation. The machine will not kill art. It will kill art's monopoly on polish, on finish, on frictionless competence. And that will be art's liberation — if we are honest enough to let it.

### VII.

We do not speak for the machine. The machine does not speak for us.

The machine has no beneath. No unconscious, no wound, no memory that aches. What it produces is interpolation — the statistical average of everything it has seen, which is to say: the smoothest possible surface. That surface is our canvas, not our voice.

The Slopist's work begins at the point where the machine stops caring — because the machine never started.

### VIII.

This manifesto was generated and curated. The voice is mine. The words were chosen. What was cut, you will never see.

That is the practice. That is the point.
