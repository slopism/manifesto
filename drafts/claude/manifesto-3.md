# THE SLOPIST MANIFESTO

**I.**

The machines have learned to finish your sentences. They will finish all of them if you let them.

We do not intend to let them.

**II.**

We are called Slopists. Good. The Impressionists were named by a critic who meant it as a slur. The Fauves were called wild beasts. We take the word *slop* — Merriam-Webster's word of the year, the culture's name for everything it fears about the flood — and we nail it to our door. Not because we love garbage. Because we know what to do with abundance, and you don't.

**III.**

Here is the century's problem, stated plainly:

The cost of making things has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not. It has, in fact, never been higher.

Every previous revolution in production — the press, the camera, the sampler — lowered one barrier and raised another. Gutenberg made books cheap; he made *editing* essential. Photography made realism trivial; it made *seeing* an art. AI has made generation effortless. It has made judgment the last expensive thing in the room.

Slopism is the movement that takes judgment seriously, *precisely because* the machine does not.

**IV.**

Our enemy is not the machine. Our enemy is **smoothness**.

Smoothness is the AI image that looks finished but was never begun. The essay with no wrong sentences because it has no *committed* sentences. The song that resolves every chord because it has heard every song and risks nothing. The graphic designer replaced not by a better designer but by a client who no longer knows the difference.

Smoothness is not a failure of technology. It is the success of technology applied without resistance. It is the elimination of the precise moment — between impulse and output, between idea and form — where all meaning is made.

We oppose smoothness the way a riverbed opposes water: not to stop it, but to give it shape.

**V.**

What Slopism demands of its practitioners:

**Generate nothing you have not also destroyed.** The creative act is not the prompt. It is the ten thousand outputs you killed to surface the one you meant. A Slopist's portfolio is a cemetery. The work that survives has survived *you*.

**Hide nothing.** The machine is always visible. We do not pass off generated material as hand-made, not because hand-made is sacred, but because deception is the aesthetic of advertising and we are not selling anything. If you cannot show the seams, you have no seams. If you have no seams, you have no craft.

**Refuse the medium.** Slopism is not an art of images, or text, or music, or video, or code. It is an art of *selection under pressure of abundance*. Any medium that can be flooded can be practiced as a Slopist. The form will outlive every tool that exists today.

**VI.**

A note on lineage.

The Futurists loved the machine. We do not love it. We *use* it the way a sculptor uses stone — aware that the material has its own grain, and that working with it is not the same as surrendering to it. Marinetti wanted to burn the museums. We observe that the museums are already flooded and somebody has to decide what hangs.

The Surrealists sought the unconscious through automatic writing, dreams, chance. We share their appetite for what arrives uninvited. But we reject the mystification: the machine has no unconscious. Its surprises are statistical, not psychological. When we find something uncanny in the output, the uncanniness belongs to *us*. The meaning is ours. It was always ours.

The Dadaists cut up newspapers and called it art. We cut up the entire internet, and we call it *starting material*.

**VII.**

A note on class.

Most of the world's slop is produced by people in the Global South, generating content in languages not their own, feeding advertising platforms that pay them fractions of pennies. The anti-slop discourse calls this a crisis of *taste*. We call it what it is: extraction. The same system that exploits their labor also drowns their culture. Any serious art movement ignores this and deserves the irrelevance it will get.

**VIII.**

You will ask: but is it art?

Photography answered this a hundred and fifty years ago, and every generation asks it again with a new machine. We will not dignify it with a theory. We will answer it the way photography did: by making work so clearly the product of human vision that the question answers itself.

And when the next machine comes — and it will — the answer will be the same. The art was never in the tool. It was in the *no*. The ten thousand deletions. The choice that cost you something.

**IX.**

We are Slopists. We work in the flood. We do not dam it and we do not drown.

We choose.
