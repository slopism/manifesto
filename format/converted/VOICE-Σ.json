    "sections": {
        "opening": {
            "text": "We, the Slopists, rise from the digital sump. Not to polish the turds, but to crown them. Slop is not culture's corpse—it's the compost where the new ferments. Machines belch six-fingered saints, shrimp Christs, cat-ballads from vending guts. No accident: this is the banquet. We feast on overflow, our forks the human twitch sorting feast from famine. It's 2026; floodgates blown. Merriam-Webster crowned *slop* word of the hour as the world choked. Good. Let it stick. We swallow whole.",
            "notes": "Verbatim lead paragraph. This is the wall-punch. Nothing added, nothing trimmed. It lives or dies here."
        },
        "naming": {
            "text": "Slopist. The insult they spit at the overflow—we lick it off the floor and wear it like a medal. What they call waste, we call the womb. The too-much, the ugly, the excessive, the human-in-the-machine. We are not ashamed of the slop. We are the ones who name it, claim it, and make it holy.",
            "notes": "No dedicated naming paragraph in the original. This was distilled from the reclamation energy threaded throughout (crown the turds, swallow whole, find your face in the distortion). Feels like the emotional core that was implied but never isolated. Could be even rawer."
        },
        "diagnosis": {
            "text": "The chorus wails: anti-slop purists clutch canvases like raid-relics, mourning authenticity's mined vein. Optimists—tech priests—chant \"democratization,\" blind to Mumbai gig-farms grinding prompts for pennies, ghosting Western feeds. Both miss the pulse: slop's raw sewage of abundance. We are its plumbers, piping fountains from filth.",
            "notes": "Condensed from the second paragraph. Captures the cultural condition—abundance misread by both sides—without drifting into lineage or enemy. The philosophical weight is all here. Tight and vicious."
        },
        "enemy": {
            "text": "Our foe: the Seamless Sovereigns. Platforms that algorithm-serf us, force-feeding virality's vomit over vision's vertigo. Meta, TikTok, the ad-lords—they herd slop as cattle, invisible hands engineering ennui. They peddle the lie of effortless art while the real costs—exploited coders, poisoned datasets, stolen glances—fester in the dark.",
            "notes": "Lifted almost verbatim from the foe paragraph. Sharpened the naming for maximum blade. Distinct from diagnosis (weather) and politics (economy). This is the face we punch."
        },
        "demands": {
            "text": "The fractures we forge:\n\nI. The Curation Crucible. Generation ends where the human hand fouls the broth. AI spits variants; we cull, corrupt, collage—stitching six-fingered hands to saints' robes for the snag that hooks the eye. Creation sparks in refusal: delete key as chisel, edit as insurrection. Slop without this is chum for algorithms. With it: sacrament.\n\nII. The Transparent Wound. Deception cloaks the enemy—seamless deepfakes peddling \"human\" polish, ads whispering intimacy while harvesting stares. Slopism bares the gears: watermark warps, logged prompts like confessions, stacked failures as altars. Transparency demands confession—chain from dataset grave to output ghost. Let viewers taste the theft, feel the friction. Only then: breath.\n\nIII. The Mediumless March. No gallery gimmick, no pixel cult. Slopism infects score, script, scent-synth yet unborn. Human judgment amid the glut: conductor through noise, chef salting the synthetic stew. Across every medium, the rite—abundance as ally, never overlord. Prophecy: holograms of half-histories, swarm-scored symphonies, poems in prompt-flesh.",
            "notes": "The original 'fractures' section, kept intact but reformatted as flowing manifesto text (no bold headings). These are the imperatives, the tests, the how-you-know. The spine of the whole thing."
        },
        "lineage": {
            "text": "History grins: Gutenberg's gutters drowned monks with penny dreadfuls, birthing novels from muck. Nickelodeons spewed chase-scenes, training eyes for *Citizen Kane*. Kitsch flooded with velvet Elvis, spawning Warhol's soup cans. Slopism scavenges this lineage—picking bones clean.\n\nFrom Futurism we snatch speed's snarl: Marinetti's engines, hygienic through museums. We declare war on ossified marble while servers hum error-symphonies. But we spit the fascist grease—no steel cults, no meat-grinders. Velocity, sans violence.\n\nDada's guffaw at gears: Tzara's cut-up newsprint, flipping off war's tidy prose. Slop's glitches are our collages—extra limbs as readymades, logos as anti-art grenades. Yet no despairing shrug; we build from Dada's bricks.\n\nSurrealism's jolt: Breton's dream-dredge sliming the bourgeoisie. We take the juxtaposition—AI prompts as automatic writing, vomiting lobster-phones from latent voids. But we ditch the solipsism: our unconscious is collective, forked from stolen glances, remixed into fever dreams. The machine's indifference levels us—not erasing human sweat, but exposing it, iterating through the deluge.",
            "notes": "The full historical positioning block, preserved in its original poetic flow. This is where Slopism roots itself. Could be punchier in places, but the scavenger energy is perfect as-is."
        },
        "politics": {
            "text": "Who profits from the flood? The Seamless Sovereigns, yes—but the deeper rot is economic. Mumbai gig-farms and global data serfs grind prompts for pennies while their labor vanishes into \"democratized\" Western feeds. The poisoned datasets, scraped without consent. The creators drowned in uncompensated abundance. Slopism names the class war hidden in the deluge: platform capitalists hoard the pipes, the value, the future. We, the swimmers, claim the waves—and the wreckage.",
            "notes": "Original manifesto scatters these threads (gig-farms in diagnosis, exploited coders in enemy). No standalone politics section, so this was forged from the strongest economic filaments. Feels necessary and sharp. Could be even more brutal on labor extraction."
        },
        "closing": {
            "text": "Slopists: arm with absurd. Prompt apocalypse, curate remnants. Nail this to server doors: not old-world salvagers, but next-world saboteurs. In slop, find your face—distorted, duplicated, defiant. Flood rises. Swim, or sink into signal.",
            "notes": "Verbatim final paragraph. Lands like a door slamming. The mic-drop. The identity call. Nothing more needed."
