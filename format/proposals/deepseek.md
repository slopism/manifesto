  "title": {
    "text": "THE SLOPIST MANIFESTO",
    "notes": "Kept the original all-caps title for impact."
  },
  "preamble": {
    "text": "We are drowning in abundance. Every second, machines birth images no human eye will see, texts no human mind will read, music no human ear will hear. The generators never sleep. They give us everything we ask for. This is the problem.\n\nThey called us slop. They meant it as an epithet—the vomit of the machine, the overspill of a culture that forgot how to make by hand. We wear the name like a stolen coat. Let them call it slop. The word will taste different in five years.\n\nHere is the only question that matters: What do you do with ten thousand images?\n\nThe old world was organized around lack. Skill was rare. Vision required years to execute. That gap is now optional. The artist who cannot draw is no longer silent. The question is not whether they speak, but whether they have anything to say.",
    "notes": "Combined points 1-3. The opening establishes the problem of abundance and the slur, then poses the central question."
  },
  "core_principle": {
    "text": "Slopism has one law: The machine generates. The human chooses.\n\nWe are not prompt-engineers. We are not illustrators who hired a faster pencil. We are curators swimming in infinite inventory. If you accept the first output, you are a consumer of slop. If you reject nine hundred and ninety-nine to find the one that means something, you are one of us.",
    "notes": "Point 4. The core law is stated plainly, followed by a definition of who we are."
  },
  "enemy": {
    "text": "The enemy is not AI. The enemy is the prompt-and-accept mind—the human who treats the first output as finished, who mistakes the machine's dream for their own intention. That is not slopism. That is surrender.",
    "notes": "Point 5. Clearly names the adversary."
  },
  "aesthetics": {
    "text": "We never hide the machine. The work must wear its making like a skin. If it could be mistaken for human craft, it has failed. Transparency is not confession—it is aesthetic. Show the seam. Show the glitch. Show the moment the statistical model guessed wrong and you kept the guess because it was stranger than what you wanted.",
    "notes": "Point 6. Emphasizes the visible evidence of the machine's role."
  },
  "lineage": {
    "text": "We inherit nothing from the Futurists. They worshipped speed. We are drowning in it. They wanted to burn the museums. We want to know why the museum still matters when anyone can generate a thousand canvases before breakfast.\n\nWe inherit everything from Duchamp. He understood that the readymade was not the object but the choice of the object. We are Duchamp's children in an age where everything is already a readymade—where the gesture is not choosing one object among many but choosing one image among an infinity.",
    "notes": "Point 7. Positions Slopism against Futurists and in line with Duchamp."
  },
  "medium": {
    "text": "The slop is not the problem. The slop is the raw ore. The problem is that you have forgotten how to smelt.\n\nThe machine gives you everything. That is the abundance. The solution is to want less.\n\nThis is a movement for every medium and no medium. Text, image, sound, video—the relationship is the same. Human judgment meeting machine fertility. The endless yes of the generator answered by the finite no of the curator.\n\nThe work will be made of slop. But it will not be slop.",
    "notes": "Points 8-9. Discusses the nature of the medium and the need for discernment."
  },
  "call_to_action": {
    "text": "You who read this: you have already scrolled past a thousand images, a hundred hot takes, fifty variations on the same idea. You have already participated in the flood.\n\nThe question is not whether you will use the machine. You will. Everyone will. The question is whether you will use it as a machine—as a thing that outputs until you tell it to stop—or whether you will use it as a medium, which means entering into a relationship with it, which means pushing back, which means saying no more often than you say yes.",
    "notes": "Point 10. Directly addresses the reader, challenging them to choose."
  },
  "closing": {
    "text": "We are Slopists. We work with what we are given. We are given everything. Our task is to find, among the everything, the something that was waiting for us.\n\nThe machine generates. We choose.\n\nCome find us in the flood. We are the ones who are not drowning.",
    "notes": "Point 11. Ends with a memorable, poetic call."
