        "version": "B",
        "why": "Version B clearly articulates the central problem—the collapse of making cost versus the rising cost of choosing—and places it in a historical context of previous media revolutions. It directly defines Slopism as a movement that takes judgment seriously, making it both accessible and intellectually grounded."
    },
    "worst": {
        "version": "E",
        "why": "Version E is too brief and incomplete as an opening section. While the hook is strong, it offers no context, explanation, or positioning of the movement, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the manifesto's purpose."
