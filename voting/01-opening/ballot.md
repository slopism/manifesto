You are voting on sections for the Slopism manifesto — an art
movement about human judgment meeting machine abundance.

5 versions of the **OPENING** section. You don't know who wrote which.

## VERSION A

Machines have learned to finish your sentences. They will finish all of them if you let them.

They call the overflow slop: a pollution event, the grey goo of culture. We see a quarry.

We do not intend to dam the flood. We intend to carve a channel through it.


## VERSION B

The machines have learned to finish your sentences. They will finish all of them if you let them.

We do not intend to let them.

Here is the century's problem, stated plainly:

The cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not. It has never been higher.

Every revolution in production — the press, the camera, the sampler — lowered one barrier and raised another. Gutenberg made books cheap; he made editing essential. Photography made realism trivial; it made seeing an art. AI has made generation effortless. It has made judgment the last expensive thing in the room.

Slopism is the movement that takes judgment seriously, precisely because the machine cannot.


## VERSION C

The machines have learned to finish your sentences. They will finish all of them if you let them. We live under a flood of finished-looking mediocrity—a rain of plausible sentences, average images, and songs that have heard every song.

They see a pollution event. We see a quarry.

We do not intend to drink from the deluge. We intend to build with it. We are not here to clean the internet; we are here to make a practice inside the ruin.


## VERSION D

The cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not.

We stand in the flood. Machines belch six-fingered saints and shrimp Christs from the digital sump. They finish every sentence, every canvas, every dream before we have time to want it.

Slop is not the machine’s vomit. Slop is publication without judgment.

We do not dam the deluge. We quarry it.


## VERSION E

The machines have learned to finish your sentences. They will finish all of them if you let them.

We do not intend to let them.

`ranking` is best-to-worst (first entry = your #1 pick).
`proposed_replacement` is null unless you think none are good enough.
