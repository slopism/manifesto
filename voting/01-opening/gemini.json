        "version": "B",
        "why": "This version provides the strongest intellectual scaffolding for the movement. By contextualizing AI within the history of production (Gutenberg, Photography), it elevates Slopism from a mere reaction to a necessary evolution of art. It perfectly identifies the core economic shift: the scarcity of judgment in an era of infinite generation."
    },
    "worst": {
        "version": "E",
        "why": "It presents the conflict but offers no synthesis or solution. It functions more as a slogan than an opening manifesto section, lacking the vital pivot toward using judgment as a tool."
