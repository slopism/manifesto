The two-sentence opener lands like a slap and a smile, then glides straight into the stolen-coat metaphor without a single wasted word. The final sentence is the cleanest, most precise articulation of the entire philosophy: the Slopist as editor, not author. Rhythm, temperature, and swagger are identical to the manifesto’s."
