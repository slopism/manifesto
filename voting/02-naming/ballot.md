**I.**

The machines have learned to finish your sentences. They will finish all of them if you let them.

We do not intend to let them.

Here is the century's problem, stated plainly:

The cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not. It has never been higher.

Every revolution in production — the press, the camera, the sampler — lowered one barrier and raised another. Gutenberg made books cheap; he made editing essential. Photography made realism trivial; it made seeing an art. AI has made generation effortless. It has made judgment the last expensive thing in the room.

Slopism is the movement that takes judgment seriously, precisely because the machine cannot.

5 versions of the **NAMING** section. You don't know who wrote which.

## VERSION A

They called us slop. Good.

We wear the name like a stolen coat. Not because we love garbage, but because we know what to do with abundance.

A Slopist does not sign a prompt. A Slopist signs the cut: what was refused, what was spared, what was framed, what was named.


## VERSION B

They call it 'slop.' They mean it as an insult—the vomit of the machine, the overspill of a culture that forgot how to make by hand. We wear the name like a stolen coat.

A Slopist does not sign a prompt. A Slopist signs the cut. We are the ones who lick the insult off the floor and make it holy.


## VERSION C

They call it slop — the culture's name for everything it fears about the flood. The Impressionists were named by a critic who meant it as a slur. The Fauves were called wild beasts. We take the word and nail it to our door.

A Slopist does not sign a prompt. A Slopist signs the cut: what was refused, what survived, what was named.


## VERSION D

They spit the word *slop* like a curse. We lick it off the floor and nail it to our door.

A Slopist does not sign the prompt. A Slopist signs the cut: what was refused, what was spared, what was framed, what was named.

We wear the name like a stolen coat. Because we know what to do with abundance, and you still don’t.


## VERSION E

They called us slop. Merriam-Webster crowned it 2025's Word of the Year as the world choked. They meant it as an epithet — the vomit of the machine, the overspill of a culture that forgot how to choose.

We wear the name like a stolen coat.

The Impressionists were named by a critic who meant it as a slur. The Fauves were called wild beasts. We take the word and nail it to our door. Not because we love garbage. Because we know what to do with abundance, and you don't.

Slop is not culture's corpse. It is the compost where the new ferments.

`ranking` is best-to-worst (first entry = your #1 pick).
`proposed_replacement` is null unless you think none are good enough.
