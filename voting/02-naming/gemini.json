        "version": "A",
        "why": "It is the tightest continuation of Section I's argument about abundance vs. judgment. It avoids over-explaining the insult (unlike B and E) and avoids the visceral/gross imagery of 'licking the floor' (B and D), which clashes with the high-minded, intellectual tone established in the introduction. The rhythm of the final list ('refused, spared, framed, named') perfectly executes the concept of 'judgment' introduced in the previous section."

    "worst": {
        "version": "E",
        "why": "The reference to 'Merriam-Webster's 2025 Word of the Year' instantly dates the manifesto and breaks the timeless, philosophical voice established in Section I. It feels like a news article rather than a declaration of a movement."
