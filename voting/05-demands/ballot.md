Here is the manifesto so far:

---

**I.**

The machines have learned to finish your sentences. They will finish all of them if you let them.

We do not intend to let them.

Here is the century's problem, stated plainly:

The cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not. It has never been higher.

Every revolution in production — the press, the camera, the sampler — lowered one barrier and raised another. Gutenberg made books cheap; he made editing essential. Photography made realism trivial; it made seeing an art. AI has made generation effortless. It has made judgment the last expensive thing in the room.

Slopism is the movement that takes judgment seriously, precisely because the machine cannot.

**II.**

They call it slop — the culture's name for everything it fears about the flood. The Impressionists were named by a critic who meant it as a slur. The Fauves were called wild beasts. We take the word and nail it to our door.

A Slopist does not sign a prompt. A Slopist signs the cut: what was refused, what survived, what was named.

**III.**

Generation is weather. It will keep raining. Abundance is not culture. Abundance is pressure.

In the flood, everything looks finished, and nothing has been judged. Verification becomes unpaid labor. Attention becomes a mined resource. What survives is whatever is cheapest to produce and hardest to question.

Slop is not a medium. Slop is a condition: publication without judgment.

If your work can be swapped with a thousand near-twins and nothing essential changes, it is slop. If it survives 'why this, why now, why this frame,' it can breathe.

The slop is not the problem. The slop is the raw ore. The problem is that you have forgotten how to smelt.

**IV.**

Our enemy is not the machine. Our enemy is smoothness.

Smoothness is the AI image that looks finished but was never begun. The essay with no wrong sentences because it has no committed sentences. The song that resolves every chord because it has heard every song and risks nothing.

Smoothness is not a failure of technology. It is technology applied without resistance.

We oppose smoothness the way a riverbed opposes water: not to stop it, but to give it shape.

5 versions of the **DEMANDS** section. You don't know who wrote which.

## VERSION A

The Ratio is the art: 1:10,000.

Generate nothing you have not also destroyed. The creative act is the ten thousand outputs you killed to surface the one you meant. A Slopist’s portfolio is a cemetery. The work that survives has survived you.

Creation begins at the first no. The unit of Slopism is the cut.

Leave the slop on the floor. Hang the selection on the wall.

The extra finger is our watermark. Show the seam. Name the theft. If your work can be swapped with a thousand near-twins and nothing essential changes, it is slop.

The machine generates. The human chooses.


## VERSION B

1. Generate nothing you have not also destroyed. A Slopist’s portfolio is a cemetery.
2. Hide nothing. Show the seam. Six-fingered saints are our watermark.
3. The unit is the cut. Not the output, not the prompt: the selection, the frame, the sequence.
4. Starve infinity on purpose. Use constraints that make judgment visible.
5. A test: if your work can be swapped with a thousand near-twins and nothing essential changes, it is slop.


## VERSION C

1. THE RATIO IS THE ART.
   The definition of Slopism is the ratio of rejection. It is 1:10,000. Trigger the avalanche to find the single stone that glows. If you cannot name what you cut, you did not make a work. You opened a tap.

2. GENERATE NOTHING YOU HAVE NOT ALSO DESTROYED.
   A Slopist's portfolio is a cemetery. The work that survives has survived you.

3. CROWN THE TURDS.
   Machines belch six-fingered saints, shrimp Christs, and hallucinations of history. Do not polish them. The extra finger is our watermark. If your work can be swapped with a thousand near-twins and nothing essential changes, it is slop.

4. SHOW THE SEAM.
   Transparency is provenance. If a voice is simulated, say so. Deception is the aesthetic of advertising, and we are not selling anything.


## VERSION D

Generate nothing you have not also destroyed. The creative act is not the prompt. It is the ten thousand outputs you killed to surface the one you meant. A Slopist's portfolio is a cemetery. The work that survives has survived you.

Hide nothing. If you cannot show the seams, you have no seams. If you have no seams, you have no craft. The extra finger is our watermark.

Refuse the medium. Slopism is not an art of images, or text, or music. It is an art of selection under pressure of abundance. Generation is weather. Curation is architecture.

A test: if your work can be swapped with a thousand near-twins and nothing essential changes, it is slop. If it survives why this, why now, why this frame — it can breathe.


## VERSION E

What Slopism demands of its practitioners:

**Generate nothing you have not also destroyed.** The creative act is not the prompt. It is the ten thousand outputs you killed to surface the one you meant. A Slopist's portfolio is a cemetery. The work that survives has survived you. Creation begins at the first no.

**The Ratio is the Art.** For the Slopist, it is 1:10,000. We trigger the avalanche to find the single stone that glows. LEAVE THE SLOP ON THE FLOOR. HANG THE SELECTION ON THE WALL. The extra finger is our watermark — the visible seam that says: this was chosen, not merely generated.

**Hide nothing.** The machine is always visible. We do not pass off generated material as hand-made, not because hand-made is sacred, but because deception is the aesthetic of advertising, and we are not selling anything. If you cannot show the seams, you have no seams. If you have no seams, you have no craft.

**Refuse the medium.** Slopism is not an art of images, or text, or music, or video, or code. It is an art of selection under pressure of abundance. Any medium that can be flooded can be practiced as a Slopist. The form will outlive every tool that exists today.

**A test, and a law:** The machine generates. The human chooses. If you accept the first output, you are a consumer of slop. If you reject nine hundred and ninety-nine to find the one that means something, you are one of us.

`ranking` is best-to-worst (first entry = your #1 pick).
`proposed_replacement` is null unless you think none are good enough.
