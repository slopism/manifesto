        "why": "It flows like the riverbed in IV—opposing the flood without stopping it. The prose stays in the manifesto’s register: short, scarred sentences, metaphors that bite back. It directly answers the smoothness problem with \"Refuse the medium\" and \"Curation is architecture,\" then lands the kill-shot test that echoes III’s \"why this, why now.\" No lists, no shouting, just the cut made visible."

    "worst": {
        "version": "B",
        "why": "It turns the manifesto into a PowerPoint. The numbered commandments kill the rhythm dead. The voice that was singing in I–IV suddenly sounds like a subreddit rules post."
