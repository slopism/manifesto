        "version": "E",
        "why": "It preserves the manifesto’s declarative, paragraph-driven cadence while shifting cleanly into imperatives. It reuses existing motifs (weather/flood, the cut, the seam) without feeling like a different document, and it escalates into a final law that lands as a refrain rather than a list."
    },
    "worst": {
        "version": "C",
        "why": "The all-caps headers and shock-joke phrasing (“CROWN THE TURDS”) yank the tone toward sneer/comedy, breaking the controlled seriousness and rhythm established in I–IV. It reads like a different movement speaking over this one."
