        "why": "This is the only version that expands the argument rather than repeating it. It introduces a crucial new dimension ('Refuse the medium') and avoids the fatal error of Versions A, B, C, and D, which all repeat the 'near-twins' definition already established verbatim in Section III. While slightly more didactic, it successfully transitions from the philosophical ('Generation is weather') to the practical ('The Ratio is 1:10,000'), providing a substantial and distinct conclusion."

        "version": "D",
        "why": "It acts as a summary rather than a continuation. It recycles nearly 50% of its text from Section III (the definition of slop and the 'why this, why now' test), bringing the manifesto's momentum to a dead halt."
