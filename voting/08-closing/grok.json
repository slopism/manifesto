        "version": "C",
        "why": "It is the only version that truly *continues* rather than just ends. It picks up the thread from I (photography as precedent), V (the ten thousand deletions, the cost), III/IV (the flood that must neither be dammed nor drowned in), and the overall voice of defiant, historical self-awareness. The rhythm is perfect: question → historical echo → refusal of theory → lived practice → self-naming → final triad of resistance → We choose. It feels inevitable after VII."

    "worst": {
        "version": "A",
        "why": "It is the most standalone and therefore the least continuous. \"Practice inside the ruin\" is a fresh image but it doesn’t sing with the flood/smelting/riverbed language that dominates the manifesto. It also dodges the \"but is it art?\" confrontation that every stronger version leans into. Too polite, too small."
