Unlike B, C, and E, it avoids the defensive posture of asking 'is it art?', instead asserting a confident position 'inside the ruin'—a necessary acknowledgement of the ethical complexities raised in Section VII."

        "version": "E",
        "why": "It creates an immediate, jarring redundancy by repeating the 'Leave the slop on the floor' line, which was already shouted in all-caps in Section V. It brings nothing new to the conclusion."
