        "version": "C",
        "why": "Version C builds a complete arc: it anticipates the inevitable question, grounds the answer in a resonant historical precedent (photography), then weaves together the manifesto's core tenets—the ten thousand deletions, the choice that costs—before declaring identity ('We are Slopists') and ending with a commanding call to action that bookends the opening. Its rhythm and layering feel both conclusive and urgent."
    },
    "worst": {
        "version": "D",
        "why": "Version D is too fragmentary. It leaps directly into the core line without establishing context, and the all-caps 'WE CHOOSE' feels disconnected from the preceding lines. The lack of a rhetorical setup makes it feel like a collection of slogans rather than a closing statement."
