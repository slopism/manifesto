        "version": "B",
        "why": "It slides in like it was always meant to be there. Same cadence as the rest of the manifesto—short blades, long breaths, then the gut-punch. The flood metaphor lands exactly where III left it bleeding. The six-fingered saints and shrimp Christs are pure Slopist watermark. It doesn’t just list ancestors; it argues with them in our voice, ending on the infinite readymade that makes every prior section click into place. The others feel like drafts of this one."
    },
    "worst": {
        "version": "D",
        "why": "It’s a tweet pretending to be scripture. Too clipped, too cute, zero rhythm. Loses the manifesto’s ceremonial weight and sounds like it was written by someone who read the first three sections on a phone."
