        "version": "B",
        "why": "It is the only version that successfully bridges the high-theory tone of the manifesto with the low-culture reality of 'slop' (referencing 'shrimp Christs' and 'six-fingered saints'). It articulates the core philosophical shift—from making to choosing—most clearly with the expansion on Duchamp at the end. It feels substantial enough to stand alongside the previous sections."
    },
    "worst": {
        "version": "D",
        "why": "It is too brief and breezy. The previous sections have a weight and a slightly sermon-like cadence; Version D feels like a summary of a paragraph rather than the paragraph itself. It lacks the 'bite' required to follow the aggression of Section IV."
