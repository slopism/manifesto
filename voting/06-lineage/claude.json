        "why": "C matches the manifesto's voice most precisely: declarative, muscular, no wasted clauses. It keeps the three-movement structure (Futurists/Surrealists/Dadaists-Duchamp) but compresses each to its sharpest form. The sculptor-and-stone line earns its place because it echoes Section IV's riverbed metaphor — resistance as shaping force. It closes on 'starting material,' which hands the baton back to the manifesto's central demand: judgment. Unlike B, it doesn't over-explain; unlike D, it doesn't under-furnish."
    },
    "worst": {
        "version": "A",
        "why": "A opens with Duchamp but then rushes through Futurism and Surrealism as afterthoughts. It reads like notes toward a section rather than the section itself. The manifesto earns its authority through controlled elaboration — A is too thin to carry that weight, and its ordering (Duchamp first, then backward through the movements) breaks the chronological momentum the other versions build."
