Here is the manifesto so far:

---

**I.**

The machines have learned to finish your sentences. They will finish all of them if you let them.

We do not intend to let them.

Here is the century's problem, stated plainly:

The cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not. It has never been higher.

Every revolution in production — the press, the camera, the sampler — lowered one barrier and raised another. Gutenberg made books cheap; he made editing essential. Photography made realism trivial; it made seeing an art. AI has made generation effortless. It has made judgment the last expensive thing in the room.

Slopism is the movement that takes judgment seriously, precisely because the machine cannot.

**II.**

They call it slop — the culture's name for everything it fears about the flood. The Impressionists were named by a critic who meant it as a slur. The Fauves were called wild beasts. We take the word and nail it to our door.

A Slopist does not sign a prompt. A Slopist signs the cut: what was refused, what survived, what was named.

**III.**

Generation is weather. It will keep raining. Abundance is not culture. Abundance is pressure.

In the flood, everything looks finished, and nothing has been judged. Verification becomes unpaid labor. Attention becomes a mined resource. What survives is whatever is cheapest to produce and hardest to question.

Slop is not a medium. Slop is a condition: publication without judgment.

If your work can be swapped with a thousand near-twins and nothing essential changes, it is slop. If it survives 'why this, why now, why this frame,' it can breathe.

The slop is not the problem. The slop is the raw ore. The problem is that you have forgotten how to smelt.

**IV.**

Our enemy is not the machine. Our enemy is smoothness.

Smoothness is the AI image that looks finished but was never begun. The essay with no wrong sentences because it has no committed sentences. The song that resolves every chord because it has heard every song and risks nothing.

Smoothness is not a failure of technology. It is technology applied without resistance.

We oppose smoothness the way a riverbed opposes water: not to stop it, but to give it shape.

**V.**

What Slopism demands of its practitioners:

**Generate nothing you have not also destroyed.** The creative act is not the prompt. It is the ten thousand outputs you killed to surface the one you meant. A Slopist's portfolio is a cemetery. The work that survives has survived you. Creation begins at the first no.

**The Ratio is the Art.** For the Slopist, it is 1:10,000. We trigger the avalanche to find the single stone that glows. LEAVE THE SLOP ON THE FLOOR. HANG THE SELECTION ON THE WALL. The extra finger is our watermark — the visible seam that says: this was chosen, not merely generated.

**Hide nothing.** The machine is always visible. We do not pass off generated material as hand-made, not because hand-made is sacred, but because deception is the aesthetic of advertising, and we are not selling anything. If you cannot show the seams, you have no seams. If you have no seams, you have no craft.

**Refuse the medium.** Slopism is not an art of images, or text, or music, or video, or code. It is an art of selection under pressure of abundance. Any medium that can be flooded can be practiced as a Slopist. The form will outlive every tool that exists today.

**A test, and a law:** The machine generates. The human chooses. If you accept the first output, you are a consumer of slop. If you reject nine hundred and ninety-nine to find the one that means something, you are one of us.

**VI.**

The Futurists loved the machine. We use it the way a sculptor uses stone — aware that the material has its own grain, and that working with it is not the same as surrendering to it. Marinetti wanted to burn the museums. We note that the museums are already flooded and someone has to decide what hangs.

The Surrealists sought the unconscious through automatic writing and chance. We share their appetite for what arrives uninvited. But the machine has no unconscious. Its surprises are statistical, not psychological. When we find something uncanny in the output — six-fingered saints, shrimp Christs — the uncanniness belongs to us. The meaning was always ours.

The Dadaists cut up newspapers. We are Duchamp's children in an age where everything is already a readymade. We cut up the entire internet and call it starting material.

5 versions of the **POLITICS** section. You don't know who wrote which.

## VERSION A

The flood is not neutral. It has owners.

Most of the world's slop is produced by people in the Global South, generating content in languages not their own, feeding platforms that pay them fractions of pennies. Mumbai gig-farms grind prompts for pennies while their labor vanishes into 'democratized' Western feeds. The datasets are scraped without consent. The creators are drowned in uncompensated abundance.

The anti-slop discourse calls this a crisis of taste. We call it what it is: extraction.

Slopism names the class war hidden in the deluge. The market is not a judge. It is a cashier. Do not confuse liquidity with legitimacy.

When platforms can print infinite content, they can also collapse wages, drown small voices, and call it democratization. Slopism is a refusal of that bargain. We will not trade judgment for reach. We will not trade labor for lies.

To choose, to curate, to say no is to reclaim agency from those who would drown us in their abundance.


## VERSION B

The flood is engineered. It has owners, and it has victims.

Taste becomes verification labor; culture becomes extraction. The market is not a judge. It is a cashier. Most slop is produced and cleaned by people paid fractions of pennies, while platforms sell the illusion of effortless art.

Slopism refuses to launder that theft into “content.” We disclose provenance, we credit, we pay, we build with the commons, or we do not publish.


## VERSION C

The flood has owners.

Most of the world's slop is produced by people in the Global South, generating content in languages not their own, feeding platforms that pay them fractions of pennies. The anti-slop discourse calls this a crisis of taste. We call it what it is: extraction.

The market is not a judge. It is a cashier. Do not confuse liquidity with legitimacy.

Any art movement that ignores this deserves the irrelevance it will get.


## VERSION D

The flood is not neutral. It has owners. 

Most of the world's slop is extracted from the Global South, fed into platforms that pay fractions of pennies to label the data that trains the models that replace the laborers. The market is not a judge; it is a cashier.

We refuse to aestheticize this theft. We acknowledge that our paint is made of scraped data. We oppose the Seamless Sovereigns who hoard the pipes and sell us the flow. Slopism is a refusal of the bargain: we will not trade judgment for reach.


## VERSION E

The flood has owners. It is built on Mumbai gig-farms and scraped artists, data serfs grinding prompts for pennies while their labor vanishes into “democratized” feeds.

We name the extraction. We refuse to be its gentrifiers.

Slopism is sabotage: we crown the beast, not the polish. We pay what is due, or we burn the pipes.

`ranking` is best-to-worst (first entry = your #1 pick).
`proposed_replacement` is null unless you think none are good enough.
