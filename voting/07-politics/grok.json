        "why": "It continues the voice with the same terse, sculpted sentences and layered metaphors (flood, smoothness, pipes, paint). It folds the political reality into the aesthetic argument without breaking rhythm — 'Seamless Sovereigns' is pure Slopist coinage, and the closing refusal of the bargain directly echoes the opening declaration about the cost of judgment. The others either lecture, moralize, or detonate."

    "worst": {
        "version": "E",
        "why": "It turns the manifesto into a manifesto. 'Sabotage,' 'burn the pipes,' 'gentrifiers' — these are slogans, not cuts. The tone shifts from sculptor to arsonist. The whole document has been quietly, ruthlessly choosing; this one wants to smash the studio."
