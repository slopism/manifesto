        "why": "It flows like a living continuation: picks up the 'flood' from II without repeating I, deepens the diagnosis with fresh pressure metaphors ('Abundance is pressure', 'mined resource'), sharpens the definition of slop as a condition rather than a medium, and lands the smelting line with rhythmic inevitability. The voice is pure manifesto—short, prophetic, unafraid of the reader."
