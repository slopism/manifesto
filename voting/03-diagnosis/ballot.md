Here is the manifesto so far:

**I.**

The machines have learned to finish your sentences. They will finish all of them if you let them.

We do not intend to let them.

Here is the century's problem, stated plainly:

The cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not. It has never been higher.

Every revolution in production — the press, the camera, the sampler — lowered one barrier and raised another. Gutenberg made books cheap; he made editing essential. Photography made realism trivial; it made seeing an art. AI has made generation effortless. It has made judgment the last expensive thing in the room.

Slopism is the movement that takes judgment seriously, precisely because the machine cannot.

**II.**

They call it slop — the culture's name for everything it fears about the flood. The Impressionists were named by a critic who meant it as a slur. The Fauves were called wild beasts. We take the word and nail it to our door.

A Slopist does not sign a prompt. A Slopist signs the cut: what was refused, what survived, what was named.

5 versions of the **DIAGNOSIS** section. You don't know who wrote which.

## VERSION A

Generation is weather. It will keep raining.

The cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not. Minutes to generate, hours to verify: the expense is pushed downstream into unpaid attention.

In the flood, everything looks finished and nothing has been judged. Slopism begins at the first no.


## VERSION B

Generation is weather. It will keep raining. Abundance is not culture. Abundance is pressure.

In the flood, everything looks finished, and nothing has been judged. Verification becomes unpaid labor. Attention becomes a mined resource. What survives is whatever is cheapest to produce and hardest to question.

Slop is not a medium. Slop is a condition: publication without judgment.

If your work can be swapped with a thousand near-twins and nothing essential changes, it is slop. If it survives 'why this, why now, why this frame,' it can breathe.

The slop is not the problem. The slop is the raw ore. The problem is that you have forgotten how to smelt.


## VERSION C

Here is the century's problem: The cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not. It has never been higher.

The generators never sleep. They give us everything we ask for, and that is the catastrophe. The slop is not the problem; the slop is the raw ore. The problem is that you have forgotten how to smelt.

Slopism is the movement that takes judgment seriously, precisely because the machine cannot.


## VERSION D

Here is the century's problem, stated plainly:

The cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not. It has never been higher.

Every revolution in production lowered one barrier and raised another. Gutenberg made books cheap; he made editing essential. Photography made realism trivial; it made seeing an art. AI has made generation effortless. It has made judgment the last expensive thing in the room.

The slop is not the problem. The slop is the raw ore. You have forgotten how to smelt.


## VERSION E

Generation is weather. It will keep raining.

Abundance is not culture. Abundance is pressure. The old world was organized around lack. Skill was rare. Vision took years. That gap is now optional.

The slop is the raw ore. The problem is that we forgot how to smelt.

In the flood, everything looks finished and nothing has been chosen.

`ranking` is best-to-worst (first entry = your #1 pick).
`proposed_replacement` is null unless you think none are good enough.
