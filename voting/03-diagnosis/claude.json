It introduces new conceptual territory — attention as mined resource, verification as unpaid labor, the swap test, the smelting metaphor — while matching the manifesto's staccato declarative rhythm. It earns its length."

        "why": "D is nearly a verbatim copy of Section I — the cost lines, Gutenberg, photography, all of it. Placing it as a later section would make the manifesto stutter. It adds only the smelting line, which B delivers better in context."
