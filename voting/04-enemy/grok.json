        "why": "It continues the manifesto’s voice with the same prophetic density and layered metaphors as III (flood → smelting → now smoothness as the thing that prevents smelting). The rhythm builds like the earlier sections: definition → consequence → systemic indictment → defiant image. The 'precise moment' line is the philosophical hinge the whole text has been waiting for, and 'Seamless Sovereigns' names the new landlords without breaking the tone — it feels like the natural next beat after 'publication without judgment.'"

    "worst": {
        "version": "C",
        "why": "Too clipped. It loses the incantatory repetition of examples that gives the manifesto its pulse, and 'prompt-and-accept mind' is clever but lands like a tweet instead of a clause in a creed."
