        "version": "D",
        "why": "Version D achieves a perfect balance of poetic rhythm and sharp critique. The line breaks create emphasis, the phrase 'born perfect' subtly refines the idea, and the concise introduction of 'the Seamless Sovereigns' names the enemy without overloading the paragraph. It flows directly from the previous sections and lands firmly on the riverbed metaphor, maintaining the manifesto's voice."
    },
    "worst": {
        "version": "C",
        "why": "Version C feels truncated and underdeveloped. It omits the song example, which is a key parallel in other versions, and the phrase 'deception as a style' is too vague. The lack of expansion on the initial list makes it feel incomplete, disrupting the manifesto's rhythm."
