Here is the manifesto so far:

---

**I.**

The machines have learned to finish your sentences. They will finish all of them if you let them.

We do not intend to let them.

Here is the century's problem, stated plainly:

The cost of making has collapsed to zero. The cost of choosing well has not. It has never been higher.

Every revolution in production — the press, the camera, the sampler — lowered one barrier and raised another. Gutenberg made books cheap; he made editing essential. Photography made realism trivial; it made seeing an art. AI has made generation effortless. It has made judgment the last expensive thing in the room.

Slopism is the movement that takes judgment seriously, precisely because the machine cannot.

**II.**

They call it slop — the culture's name for everything it fears about the flood. The Impressionists were named by a critic who meant it as a slur. The Fauves were called wild beasts. We take the word and nail it to our door.

A Slopist does not sign a prompt. A Slopist signs the cut: what was refused, what survived, what was named.

**III.**

Generation is weather. It will keep raining. Abundance is not culture. Abundance is pressure.

In the flood, everything looks finished, and nothing has been judged. Verification becomes unpaid labor. Attention becomes a mined resource. What survives is whatever is cheapest to produce and hardest to question.

Slop is not a medium. Slop is a condition: publication without judgment.

If your work can be swapped with a thousand near-twins and nothing essential changes, it is slop. If it survives 'why this, why now, why this frame,' it can breathe.

The slop is not the problem. The slop is the raw ore. The problem is that you have forgotten how to smelt.

5 versions of the **ENEMY** section. You don't know who wrote which.

## VERSION A

Our enemy is not the machine. Our enemy is smoothness.

Smoothness is the AI image that looks finished but was never begun. The essay with no wrong sentences because it has no committed sentences. The song that resolves every chord because it has heard every song and risks nothing. The designer replaced not by a better designer but by a client who can no longer tell the difference.

Smoothness is technology applied without resistance. It is the elimination of the precise moment — between impulse and output, between idea and form — where all meaning is made.

The Seamless Sovereigns — Meta, TikTok, the ad-lords — they herd slop as cattle, algorithm-serf us, force-feed virality's vomit over vision's vertigo. They peddle the lie of effortless art while the real costs fester in the dark.

We oppose smoothness the way a riverbed opposes water: not to stop it, but to give it shape.


## VERSION B

Our enemy is not the machine. Our enemy is smoothness.

Smoothness is the AI image that looks finished but was never begun. It is the essay with no wrong sentences because it has no committed sentences. It is the attention furnace that pays for volume and punishes care.

We declare war on the simulation. We despise the synthetic that tries to pass as a photograph. Do not domesticate the beast; we want the beast wild. We oppose smoothness the way a riverbed opposes water: not to stop it, but to give it shape.


## VERSION C

Our enemy is not the machine. Our enemy is smoothness.

Smoothness is the image that looks finished but was never begun. The essay with no wrong sentences because it risks no committed sentences. The prompt-and-accept mind.

Smoothness is technology applied without resistance, and deception as a style. We oppose it the way a riverbed opposes water: not to stop it, but to give it shape.


## VERSION D

Our enemy is not the machine.
Our enemy is smoothness.

Smoothness is the image that looks born perfect but was never begun. The essay with no wrong sentences because it has no committed ones. The song that resolves every chord because it has heard every song and risks nothing.

Smoothness is technology applied without resistance. It is the Seamless Sovereigns peddling simulation as soul.

We oppose it the way a riverbed opposes water: not to stop it, but to give it shape.


## VERSION E

Our enemy is not the machine. Our enemy is smoothness.

Smoothness is the AI image that looks finished but was never begun. The essay with no wrong sentences because it has no committed sentences. The song that resolves every chord because it has heard every song and risks nothing.

Smoothness is not a failure of technology. It is technology applied without resistance.

We oppose smoothness the way a riverbed opposes water: not to stop it, but to give it shape.

`ranking` is best-to-worst (first entry = your #1 pick).
`proposed_replacement` is null unless you think none are good enough.
